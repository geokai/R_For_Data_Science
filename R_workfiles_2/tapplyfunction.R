# how the tapply function works:
# 1. the vector of data we want to apply a functon to
# 2. the way to break up the data into pieces
# 3. the function we want to apply to the data

# 4. we can put as the 4th element extra information
#    for instance, very common;y, we use na.rm = TRUE

# find the average deaparture delays at each airport
# Here are the airports with the largest average departure delays
tail(sort(tapply(my_DF$DepDelay, my_DF$Origin, mean, na.rm=TRUE)))


# Here are the airports with the smallest average departures delays
head(sort(tapply(my_DF$DepDelay, my_DF$Origin, mean, na.rm=TRUE)))


# Here are the airports with the largest average arrival delays
tail(sort(tapply(my_DF$ArrDelay, my_DF$Origin, mean, na.rm=TRUE)))
