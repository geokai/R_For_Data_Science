# Using tapply()
# how the tapply function works:
# 3 pieces of information:
# 1. the vector of data we want to apply a function to
# 2. the way to break up the data into pieces
# 3. the function we want to apply to the data

# 4. we can put as the 4th element extra information
#    for instance, very commonly, we use na.rm = TRUE

# Here are the airports with the largest average departure delays
